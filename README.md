# üéØ A/B Testing ‚Äì Controlled Experiments for Data-Driven Decisions

This section of my portfolio is a hands-on application of the concepts from *Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments* by Kohavi, Tang, and Xu. It showcases how I apply rigorous experimentation practices to solve business problems, optimize product decisions, and drive user engagement using statistically sound methods.

## üß™ Key Concepts Covered

- Designing control vs treatment experiments with business goals in mind
- Implementing z-tests, t-tests, and proportion tests
- Calculating p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes
- Understanding sequential testing, multiple comparisons, and randomization
- Applying CUPED, stratification, and power analysis
- Validating system trustworthiness with A/A tests
- Exploring Bayesian methods and multi-armed bandits
- Handling leakage, interference, and long-term effects
